To compare two JSON objects without considering the order of their properties, you can follow these steps in most programming languages:

Convert JSON strings to Objects: Parse the JSON strings into objects or associative arrays in your language.

Sort Properties: Sort the properties of both objects before comparing. This ensures that even if the properties are in a different order, the comparison will still work correctly.

Compare: After sorting the properties, compare the sorted objects to check for equality.
